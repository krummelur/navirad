                    NaviRad is an interactive radar simulator intended for training. The intended audience is those interested in learning
                    how a radar's view differs from reality and a chart.

                    The radar view is created with a 2D raytracer and height maps from Tilezen. This method has the potential to create very
                    accurate charts, but to mimic an actual radar some limitations have been added; lobe width, constructive interference,
                    rain clutter.
