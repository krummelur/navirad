                        <div>NaviRad is an interactive radar simulator intended for training. The intended audience is
                            those interested in learning
                            how a radar's view differs from reality and a chart.<p/>

                            The radar view is created with a 2D raytracer and height maps from TileZen. This method has
                            the potential to create very
                            accurate charts, but to mimic an actual radar some limitations have been added; beam width,
                            constructive interference and rain clutter.<p/>

                            A real radar functions by sending out a radio wave (3 or 9GHz) and register when an echo returns.
                            The radio wave has a width, the beam width, which limits it's ability to distinguish details.
                            We have implemented the same functionality, where a ray only is transmitted at a certain angle.
                            In between two rays, details are lost; just as on a real radar.<p/>
