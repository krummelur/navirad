                        <div>NaviRad is an interactive radar simulator intended for training. The intended audience is those interested in learning
                            how a radar's view differs from reality and a chart.<p/>

                            The radar view is created with a 2D raytracer and height maps from Tilezen. This method has the potential to create very
                            accurate charts, but to mimic an actual radar some limitations have been added; lobe width, constructive interference,
                            rain clutter.<p/>

                            The map view is an embedded Google Map with custom marker behaviour and infowindow.<p/>
